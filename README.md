## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed
- Expo CLI installed globally: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
- iOS Simulator or Android emulator (or physical device with Expo Go)

### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the FloodAid app directory**
   ```bash
   cd "D:\Monash\FIT5120\Actual Project\FloodAidApp"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
   
   Note: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is used to ensure compatibility with the exact dependency versions.

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Run on your preferred platform**
   - Press `i` for iOS Simulator
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your physical device

## API Integration

### Current Implementation
- **Mock Data**: App currently uses realistic mock data for demonstration
- **Flood API Service**: Ready for backend integration via `services/FloodAPI.js`
- **Real-time Updates**: Context providers support live data refresh

### Backend Integration Ready
The app is designed to integrate with the existing ML prediction system:
- `D:\Monash\FIT5120\Actual Project\Datasets\simple_flood_api.py`
- `D:\Monash\FIT5120\Actual Project\Datasets\coordinate_flood_predictor.py`

## Key Components

### Context Providers

**FloodContext**: Manages flood predictions, countdown timers, and weather data
```javascript
// Key state
currentRisk: { probability: 0.75, riskLevel: 'High', timeToFlood: {...} }
hotspots: [...] // Map markers for flood risk areas
precipitationForecast: [...] // 24-hour forecast data
```

**LocationContext**: Handles multi-location monitoring with AsyncStorage persistence
```javascript
// Sample locations
monitoredLocations: [
  { name: "Home", subtitle: "Puchong", riskLevel: "High Risk", ... },
  { name: "Workplace", subtitle: "KL Sentral", riskLevel: "Moderate Risk", ... }
]
```

**UserContext**: Tracks feature usage and user analytics
```javascript
// Usage tracking for all major features
logFeatureUsage('forecast'), logFeatureUsage('live_data'), etc.
```

### Core Screens

**ForecastScreen**: Apple Weather-styled interface with:
- Real-time flood countdown timer
- 75% flood probability indicator  
- Weather summary cards with blur effects
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

**LiveDataScreen**: Live data visualization featuring:
- Interactive map with flood hotspots
- Real-time rainfall/river level monitoring
- 24-hour precipitation forecast charts
- Regional flood risk legend

**MyLocationsScreen**: Location management with:
- Add/remove locations modal interface
- Individual risk assessments per location
- AsyncStorage persistence
- Empty state handling

## Design Philosophy

### Apple Weather Inspired
- **Visual Design**: Gradient backgrounds, blur effects, rounded corners
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with bold titles and secondary text
- **Color Scheme**: Blue primary colors with contextual risk colors
- **Interactions**: Smooth animations and intuitive gesture controls

### Malaysian Context
- **Location Focus**: Optimized for Malaysian addresses and regions
- **Risk Communication**: Clear, non-technical language for flood risks  
- **Family-Centered**: Multi-location monitoring for family safety
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Appropriate messaging and emergency guidance

## Target User: Alice Chen Persona

**Background**: 34-year-old administrative coordinator and mother of two (ages 8, 12) living in Puchong, Selangor.

**How FloodAid Helps Alice**:
- **Location-Specific Alerts**: Puchong-specific flood predictions vs generic alerts
- **Family Coordination**: Monitor home, children's schools, workplace simultaneously
- **Preparation Guidance**: Step-by-step checklists with time estimates
- **Peace of Mind**: Reliable, advance warning system for family safety

## Contributing

This project follows the existing codebase patterns from the ClimateWatchMalaysia app. When contributing:

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Use the same component structure and styling approach
2. **Context-Based State**: Extend existing context providers rather than creating new ones
3. **Apple Weather Style**: Maintain the gradient-heavy, blur-effect visual design
4. **Malaysian Focus**: Ensure all features are relevant to Malaysian flood scenarios

## Support

For technical issues or feature requests:
1. Check existing documentation in `CLAUDE.md` files
2. Review the Design Report V2 for comprehensive specifications
3. Test against the Alice Chen persona scenarios
4. Ensure compatibility with existing ML backend system
